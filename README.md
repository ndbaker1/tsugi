## ⚒️ Building

to build the extension and load it locally, run
```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

This will output the extension content into a folder named `build`, which is
ready to be loaded into chrome on the `chrome://extensions` page.

If it's too much of a chore to clone the project locally, you can always open up
a github codespace, build it, then download the folder onto your
machine 👏
